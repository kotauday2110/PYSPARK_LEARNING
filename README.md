# 🚀 PySpark Learning Journey

Welcome to my PySpark learning repository! This project captures my in-depth exploration of **Apache Spark** using **Databricks**. It includes beginner to advanced-level concepts, hands-on implementation with PySpark, and data engineering best practices.

All the corresponding notebooks and code examples are available in this repository.

## 🔍 What is Apache Spark?

A powerful open-source distributed computing system for big data processing with modules for SQL, streaming, machine learning, and graph processing.

---

## 🧠 Apache Spark Architecture

Learned the internal structure: Driver, Executors, Cluster Manager, Tasks, DAG scheduler, and how Spark distributes and processes data across nodes.

---

## 🌀 Lazy Evaluation in Spark

Understood how transformations are lazily evaluated and actions trigger execution. This allows optimization before execution.

---

## 🛠 Spark Jobs, Stages & Tasks

Analyzed how Spark breaks down a job into stages and tasks and how tasks are distributed across the cluster.

---

## 💻 Working with Databricks

* Created a **Free Databricks Account**
* Explored **Databricks UI** and **Notebook environment**
* Set up Spark clusters for running code

---

## 📥 Data Ingestion

Learned how to load data from various sources: CSV, JSON, Parquet using PySpark's reader APIs.

---

## 📒 Databricks Notebook Overview

Explored the basic interface, code execution flow, and Markdown usage inside a Databricks notebook.

---

## 🧮 Spark Cluster & Execution

Configured clusters and understood Spark's distributed execution model on Databricks.

---

## 📂 Reading Data with PySpark

Used PySpark’s `read` APIs to import data from various sources and apply schemas.

---

## 🧾 Spark DAG

Explored the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that Spark builds to plan out the execution strategy.

---

## 📐 Schema Definitions (StructType & DDL)

Used **StructType**, **StructField**, and DDL-formatted strings to define schema for complex data ingestion.

---

## 🔄 Data Transformations

Performed beginner-friendly PySpark transformations like `select`, `filter`, `withColumn`, `drop`, and more.

---

## 🚀 Intermediate Transformations

Covered intermediate concepts such as `groupBy`, `agg`, `join`, `distinct`, and chaining transformations.

---

## ⚙️ Advanced Functions in PySpark

Learned about higher-level transformations using Spark SQL functions, `explode`, `map`, `struct`, `when`, `col`, etc.

---

## 🔳 Window Functions

Learned how to use windowing operations like `rank()`, `dense_rank()`, `row_number()`, `lag()` and `lead()`.

---

## 🧠 User Defined Functions (UDFs)

Created and registered custom Python functions to use in transformations when built-in functions were insufficient.

---

## 💾 Writing Data with PySpark

Explored how to write transformed data back to various formats like CSV, JSON, and Parquet.

---

## 📤 Data Writing Modes

Learned about writing modes: `overwrite`, `append`, `ignore`, `errorIfExists`.

---

## 📁 Parquet File Format

Studied Parquet’s benefits (columnar, compressed, efficient for Spark) and used it in real scenarios.

---

## 🗃 Managed vs External Tables

Understood the difference between **managed tables** (Spark manages both data and metadata) and **external tables** (Spark manages only metadata).

---

## 📝 SparkSQL

Wrote SQL queries over Spark DataFrames using `spark.sql()` and registered temporary views for querying.
